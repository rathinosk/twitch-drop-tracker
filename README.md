## How It Works

The extension uses Twitch's GraphQL API to fetch:
- Available drop campaigns
- Your inventory and progress
- Claimed drops history

For full campaign details, it intercepts network requests when you visit the Twitch drops page, capturing drop information as campaigns are expanded.

## Permissions

- `storage`: Store campaign and progress data locally
- `cookies`: Read Twitch authentication token
- `tabs`: Open Twitch pages for data loading
- `scripting`: Inject scripts to intercept campaign data
- `host_permissions` for `twitch.tv` and `gql.twitch.tv`

## Privacy

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- Only communicates with Twitch's official API
